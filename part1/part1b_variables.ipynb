    "\n",
    "- In Javascript, variables tend to follow the `camelCase` convention. In Python, we use `snake_case` where every word is separated with an underscore.\n",
    "- Variables can contain digits but the first character of a variable name cannot be a digit. For example, `a2` is a legitimate variable name but `2a` would raise an error. \n",
    "- Variable names are case-sensitive so you can create two variables with the same spelling but if they have different lower-case/upper-case letters, they will be treated as two separate variables. The general trend is to keep your variable names lower-case (i.e., use `age` instead of `Age`)."
